# NetPractice

## Description
NetPractice is a training project focused on practical networking fundamentals. The goal is to configure IP addressing and routing for small network topologies, ensuring end‑to‑end connectivity. Each level presents a scenario that requires correct TCP/IP addressing, subnet masks, default gateways, and an understanding of how routers and switches forward traffic within the OSI model.

## Instructions
### Run the training interface
1. Launch the interface from the project root:
	- `./run.sh`
	- If needed, make it executable: `chmod +x run.sh`

### Export configurations
1. For each level, complete the topology until it is validated.
2. Use the interface export feature to generate the configuration file for that level.
3. Repeat for all levels.

### Submission requirements
- You must place 10 exported configuration files (one per level) at the repository root.
- Ensure the files are named exactly as exported by the interface.

## Resources
### Networking concepts studied
- TCP/IP addressing (IPv4)
- Subnet masks and CIDR notation
- Default gateways
- Routers and switches
- OSI layers (especially L2 and L3 behavior)
- Basic routing and next-hop decisions

### Classic references
- RFC 791: Internet Protocol
- RFC 950: Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure
- RFC 1918: Address Allocation for Private Internets
- Cisco Networking Basics documentation
- Cloudflare Learning Center: IP, subnetting, and routing guides

### AI usage
- AI was used to draft and organize this README structure and wording.
- No AI-generated content was used to solve the network levels or produce configuration exports.
